Using The EdX Bootstrap Theme
-----------------------------

To use an edX Bootstrap theme, import the ``_theme.scss`` partial file from
your chosen theme into your own Sass. Note that this file must be loaded before
any Bootstrap partial files so that the theming will be applied.

See the `sample Open edX SASS file`_ for a simple example.
